      <p>Milky Way Galaxy, Earth Place, US Street</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Run, read, science, repeat</p>

      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I do reside here, though there is a nice place to see. But no matter how near, there I shall never be. </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I find the web fascinating, and being able to interface with it may be a good first step to understanding it. Moreover, I heard there were cookies.</p>
